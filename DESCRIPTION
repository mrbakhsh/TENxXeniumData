Title: Collection of Xenium spatial data by 10X genomics
Description: 
    Collection of Xenium spatial transcriptomics datasets provided by 10x 
    Genomics, formatted into the Bioconductor classes, the SpatialExperiment 
    or SpatialFeatureExperiment (SFE), to facilitate seamless integration 
    into various applications, including examples, demonstrations, 
    and tutorials. The constructed data objects include gene expression 
    profiles, per-transcript location data, centroid, segmentation 
    boundaries (e.g., cell or nucleus boundaries), and image.
